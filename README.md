In this reading I learn the things about what you should already know to start with JavaScript. The 
definition of what is JavaScript? examples about how can javaScript be used in the client-side and the server-side.
A little comparison of JavaScript to Java because they can be sound like similar, but they are differents starting with the syntax.

variables in JS, the ways of how can you evaluate your variable to prevent an error, the scope of your variables.

### Mon 27, July 2020 *RN.- Core Components and Native Components*
I start thinking about what is React Native? In the documentation of RN says that is a framework for build and Android and iOS 
applications using React.
The difference between using components in Android and iOS. And with this framework we have a native components to work with this two OS called core components.
You can see all them in the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis) and a table with the core component that you'll mostly work (with his descriptions, how can you use that component in Android or iOS and a web analog to understand how works that component if you're familiarity on the web development)
